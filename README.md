# 📚 Exam Proctoring System

A web-based online examination platform with real-time AI-powered proctoring capabilities. The system ensures academic integrity by monitoring students during exams using face recognition, head pose detection, and audio monitoring.

## ✨ Key Features

- **User Authentication** - JWT-based secure login/registration with face recognition
- **Identity Verification** - Face matching system to verify student identity
- **Real-time Proctoring** - Continuous monitoring during exams
  - Face detection and tracking
  - Head pose detection (left/right movement)
  - Multiple person detection
  - Voice/audio monitoring
- **Exam Management** - 30+ domain-specific exams across 6 categories
- **Violation Logging** - Automatic detection and logging of suspicious activities
- **Automated Reports** - Detailed exam reports with scores and violation summaries

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Backend:**

- Flask 2.2.5 (Python Web Framework)
- SQLite (Database)
- OpenCV (Computer Vision)
- face_recognition (Face Recognition)
- PyJWT (Authentication)

**Frontend:**

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- WebRTC (Camera/Microphone Access)

**AI Models:**

- YuNet Face Detector (ONNX)
- Caffe DNN (Fallback)
- Haar Cascade (Final Fallback)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam and microphone (for proctoring)
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7weeek/SE-2025
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download face detection model** (Optional - system will use fallback if not available)

   - Place `face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx` in `models/` directory
   - Install Dlib (Refer https://github.com/7weeek/Dlib-installer)

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python next.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**

## 🎯 Proctoring Features

The system monitors the following during exams:

- **Face Detection** - Ensures student is present in frame
- **Head Pose** - Detects if student looks away (left/right)
- **Multiple Persons** - Alerts if more than one person detected
- **Voice Detection** - Monitors audio for unauthorized communication
- **Violation Logging** - All violations are logged with timestamps and severity levels

## 📊 Exam Domains

The system includes 30+ exams across 6 domains:
- Programming (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++)
- Data Science (ML, Deep Learning, Big Data)
- Web Development (HTML/CSS, React, Node.js)
- Database (SQL, NoSQL, Database Design)
- Operating Systems (OS Basics, Linux)
- Software Engineering (OOP, Design Patterns, Testing)

## 🔒 Security Features

- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Secure file upload validation
